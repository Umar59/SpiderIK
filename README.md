# SpiderIK
Making procedural walk for spider
At first I made a spider with Inversed kinematics in blender and tried to import it to unity. Unfortunantly it doesn't worked out. 
So next I removed all the poles and targets from previous rig and in unity made IK using Animation rigging. Next step i'll be creating a script for it's movement.
